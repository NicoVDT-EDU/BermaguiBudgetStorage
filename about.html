        <h2>Where do our containers come from</h2>
        <p>Currently, China is home to around 85% of the world's container producers.
            Due to inexpensive steel production and low labor costs, it is profitable to produce boxes in China.
            Additionally, given that China is the largest exporter, domestic container
            production is highly profitable. China has thus emerged as one of the key
            markets for "one-trip" containers. These brand-new, domestically produced
            containers are loaded with cargo and transported to their point of sale.
            Consequently, they complete their "one trip" to their final destination
            while also delivering cargo.
